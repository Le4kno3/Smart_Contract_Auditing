Simple Solution:
    - Buy flash loan 10 times
    - There is no msg.sender check, so we can send actions on behalf of the receiver contract (impersonation).

Analysis:
    - increase the amountToBePaid value? No
        - No visible way to do so.
    - _executeActionDuringFlashLoan exploit? No
        - This is a function definition, not an interface, and the function is defined empty.
        - It will execute nothing.
    - call receiveEther() from outside? No
        - It check for msg.sender.
        - Is there any other way from lender contract to trigger the receiveEther() function.
