     * Exploit Overview:
     * 
     * This challenge introduces the idea of proxy contracts and singleton 
     * contracts.
     * 
     * The way this works is that you can have a factory contract which deploys 
     * proxies to the Gnosis Safe singleton contract. This essentially means
     * that the proxy offloads all logic to the singleton contract with the
     * context of the proxy state. It does this through delegate calls.
     * 
     * Factory CALLS -> Proxy DELEGATECALLS -> Singleton Gnosis Safe
     * 
     * Now we can create new Gnosis safes with anyone as the owner which means
     * we can create a safe on the behalf of the beneficiraies and then 
     * ensure the factory calls back to the WalletRegistry contract. During
     * this callback the contract will transfer 10 DVT to the newly created
     * Gnosis safe. However we are unable to access it since it is solely owned
     * by one of the beneficiaries. 
     * 
     * To get around this we can install a backdoor module into the Gnosis safe
     * on initialization which DOES NOT require the signatures of the owners on
     * deployment only (if you try to add a module after deployment it does
     * require signatures).
     * 
     * You can exploit this via execTransactionFromModule() or even more simply,
     * you can run the exploit on the initialisation code of your module. Within 
     * this code you can approve the attacker/smart contract to spend the funds
     * of the Gnosis wallet.
     * 
     * Most of the logic is placed in the Smart Contract to allow this to happen
     * in one transaction. But essentially it goes:
     * 
     * 1. Deploy malicious contract
     * 2. Generate the ABI to call the setupToken() function in the malicious contract
     * 3. exploit(): Call exploit with the above ABI and the list of users
     * 4. exploit(): Generate the ABI to setup the new Gnosis wallet with the ABI from step 2
     *                  such that the callback address and function is the wallet registry
     * 5. exploit(): Call the ProxyFactory contract with the ABI from step 4 and a few other bobs
     *              with a callback to the WalletRegistry proxyCreated() function.
     * 6. createProxyWithCallback(): Deploys the new Proxy and calls setup() on the proxy
     * 7. setup(): New proxy is setup and sets up the module calling back to the malicous contract
     *              however this time is a delegate call meaning it is executed in the context
     *              of the newly create proxy contract.
     * 8. setupToken(): [proxy context] Approve 10 ether to be spent by the malicious contract
     *                  of the proxies token funds
     * 9. proxyCreated(): Callback executed on the wallet registry and passes checks and transfers
     *                      10 ether to the newly created wallet
     * 10. exploit(): Transfer the 10 ether from the Gnosis wallet to the attacker address
     * 11. Repeat for each beneficiary from within the contract and hence 1 transaction.
     * 
     * Attack contract is available at:
     * "contracts/backdoor/AttackBackdoor.sol"
