* Owner is not handled by Ownable library.
* It makes less sense to attack a wellknown standard libarary to change ownership.
* This means the only option is to somehow, using current main contract, override the owner state variable.
    * But the variable `_owner` is a private variable, which means we cannot directly access it.

* According to the hint, we need to do some kind of override such that the owner address is updated.
* This means definitely we need to make use of `codex` bytes32 array.

* Can we access any memory using the bytes32[] dynamic array?
