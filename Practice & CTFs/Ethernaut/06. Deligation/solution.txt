- The main contract is "Deligation".
- We need to change owner of "Deligation" contract.
- "Deligate" contract is the shared code.
- "Deligation" contract sends a deligate call to "Dligate" contract
    - which means the code logic will be fected from "Deligate" contract.
    - the context will be "Deligation" contract static & global variables.
- But is the order of static variables correct?
    - yes both contract has first variable as "owner" state variable.
    - this means our attack is feasible.
- there is unchecked change of owner in the shared contract "Deligate".
    - all requirements are met for attack.

Attack: We now just need to call the fallback function of "Deligation" contract sending the change of owner function as call data.

Command: Run the below command in the customized environment console of ethernaut labs.

```
var functSignature = web3.utils.sha3("pwn()")

contract.sendTransaction({data: functSignature})
```
